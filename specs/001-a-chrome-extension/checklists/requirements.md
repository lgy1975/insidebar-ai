# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-AI Sidebar Extension

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**:
- ✅ Specification correctly avoids implementation specifics (no mention of specific JS libraries, CSS frameworks, etc.)
- ✅ Focus is on user scenarios, acceptance criteria, and measurable outcomes
- ✅ Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**:
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the specification
- ✅ All 42 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-042) are testable with clear MUST statements
- ✅ 12 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-012) all include measurable metrics (time, memory, percentages)
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "Users can open the sidebar in under 2 seconds" rather than "Service worker initializes in 2s")
- ✅ 5 user stories each have detailed acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- ✅ 9 edge cases identified covering error scenarios, provider failures, storage issues, etc.
- ✅ Scope is bounded to sidebar extension with 6 AI providers and prompt library (no feature creep)
- ✅ Assumptions section clearly lists 7 dependencies and prerequisites

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**:
- ✅ Each functional requirement is tied to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ 5 user stories (P1-P5) cover all primary user flows from opening sidebar to customization
- ✅ User stories align with success criteria (e.g., US1 supports SC-001, US3 supports SC-003/SC-004)
- ✅ Specification maintains implementation-agnostic language throughout

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items validated

**Findings**: The specification is comprehensive, well-structured, and ready for the planning phase. No issues found.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create the implementation plan.
