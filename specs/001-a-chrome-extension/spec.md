# Feature Specification: Multi-AI Sidebar Extension

**Feature Branch**: `001-a-chrome-extension`
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "a chrome extension using side panel api, open ai providers in side panel, with prompt library. refer README.md as a guide."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Quick AI Access via Sidebar (Priority: P1)

As a user browsing the web, I want to quickly open an AI assistant in the browser sidebar so that I can ask questions and get help without switching tabs or windows.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the extension. Without quick AI access, the extension has no purpose. This is the minimum viable product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by installing the extension, clicking the toolbar icon or using the keyboard shortcut, and verifying that the sidebar opens with an AI provider loaded and ready to use.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the extension is installed, **When** I click the extension icon in the browser toolbar, **Then** the sidebar opens displaying an AI provider interface
2. **Given** the extension is installed, **When** I press the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+S or Cmd+Shift+S), **Then** the sidebar opens displaying an AI provider interface
3. **Given** I am logged into an AI provider in a regular browser tab, **When** I open the sidebar, **Then** the AI provider loads using my existing session (no re-login required)
4. **Given** the sidebar is open, **When** I type a message and submit it, **Then** the AI provider responds as expected
5. **Given** the sidebar is open, **When** I continue browsing other tabs, **Then** the sidebar remains accessible and functional

### User Story 2 - Switch Between Multiple AI Providers (Priority: P2)

As a user who wants to compare AI responses or use different AI strengths, I want to easily switch between multiple AI providers (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Ollama) from within the sidebar so that I can access the best AI for each task without leaving the browser.

**Why this priority**: This differentiates the extension from single-provider solutions. Users value choice and the ability to compare AI responses. However, the extension is still useful with just one provider (P1), making this P2.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by opening the sidebar and clicking through the provider tabs at the bottom to verify each AI provider loads correctly and maintains its own state.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the sidebar is open, **When** I click on different AI provider tabs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.), **Then** each provider loads in the sidebar with my existing login session
2. **Given** I am using ChatGPT in the sidebar, **When** I switch to Claude and then back to ChatGPT, **Then** my ChatGPT conversation is preserved (state maintained per provider)
3. **Given** I am not logged into a specific AI provider, **When** I switch to that provider's tab, **Then** I see the provider's login page in the sidebar
4. **Given** one AI provider is unavailable or down, **When** I switch to a different provider tab, **Then** the other provider loads successfully without errors
5. **Given** the sidebar is displaying an AI provider, **When** the provider loads, **Then** the interface is fully interactive (not blocked or restricted)

### User Story 3 - Save and Reuse Prompts (Priority: P3)

As a user who frequently uses similar prompts, I want to save my favorite prompts in a library, organize them by categories and tags, and quickly reuse them with any AI provider so that I save time and maintain consistency in my AI interactions.

**Why this priority**: Prompt library adds significant productivity value but requires the core sidebar functionality (P1) and benefits from multi-provider support (P2). Users can be productive without it, making it a nice-to-have enhancement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening the Prompt Genie tab, creating/editing/deleting prompts, organizing them with categories and tags, searching for prompts, and copying them to use with AI providers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am in the Prompt Genie tab, **When** I click the "Add New Prompt" button and fill in the title, category, tags, and content, **Then** the prompt is saved and appears in my prompt library
2. **Given** I have saved prompts, **When** I click on a prompt card, **Then** the prompt text is copied to my clipboard with visual confirmation
3. **Given** I have saved prompts, **When** I search using the search bar, **Then** only prompts matching my search query (by title, content, or tags) are displayed
4. **Given** I have saved prompts, **When** I filter by category (Coding, Writing, Analysis, Custom), **Then** only prompts in that category are displayed
5. **Given** I have a prompt selected, **When** I click the edit button, **Then** I can modify the title, category, tags, or content and save the changes
6. **Given** I have a prompt selected, **When** I click the delete button and confirm, **Then** the prompt is removed from my library
7. **Given** I have prompts saved in my library, **When** I close and reopen the browser, **Then** all my prompts are still available (persisted locally)

---

### User Story 4 - Customize Extension Settings (Priority: P4)

As a user with specific preferences, I want to configure which AI providers are visible, set my default provider, customize keyboard shortcuts, and manage my data (export/import/reset) so that the extension works exactly how I want it to.

**Why this priority**: Settings enhance user experience and control but are not essential for core functionality. Users can use the extension effectively with default settings, making this lower priority.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening the Settings tab and verifying each configuration option works as expected (enable/disable providers, set default, export/import data, reset).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am in the Settings tab, **When** I disable a specific AI provider, **Then** that provider's tab no longer appears in the sidebar navigation
2. **Given** I am in the Settings tab, **When** I select a default AI provider, **Then** the sidebar opens to that provider by default
3. **Given** I am in the Settings tab, **When** I click "Export Settings & Prompts", **Then** a JSON file is downloaded containing all my settings and prompt library data
4. **Given** I have an exported settings file, **When** I click "Import Settings & Prompts" and select the file, **Then** my settings and prompts are restored from the file
5. **Given** I am in the Settings tab, **When** I click "Reset All Data" and confirm, **Then** all settings return to defaults and all prompts are deleted
6. **Given** I want to customize keyboard shortcuts, **When** I navigate to the browser's extension shortcuts page, **Then** I can configure custom shortcuts for opening the sidebar and prompt library

---

### User Story 5 - Context Menu Quick Access (Priority: P5)

As a user browsing web content, I want to right-click anywhere on a page and open the sidebar with my preferred AI provider so that I can quickly get AI assistance related to what I'm viewing.

**Why this priority**: This is a convenient enhancement but not essential. Users can always use the toolbar icon or keyboard shortcut (P1). This adds a third access method for user convenience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by right-clicking on any webpage, selecting "Open in Smarter Panel" from the context menu, choosing an AI provider, and verifying the sidebar opens to that provider.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on any webpage, **When** I right-click anywhere on the page, **Then** I see "Open in Smarter Panel" in the context menu
2. **Given** I right-click and select "Open in Smarter Panel", **When** I choose a specific AI provider from the submenu, **Then** the sidebar opens with that provider loaded
3. **Given** I use the context menu to open the sidebar, **When** the sidebar opens, **Then** it functions identically to opening via toolbar icon or keyboard shortcut

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a user is not logged into an AI provider?** The sidebar displays the provider's login page, allowing the user to log in directly within the sidebar iframe.
- **What happens when an AI provider changes their website structure or URL?** The provider may fail to load or display incorrectly. The extension should handle iframe errors gracefully with a user-friendly error message.
- **What happens when the user's browser storage is full?** Saving new prompts or settings may fail. The extension should display an error message suggesting the user delete old prompts or export their data.
- **What happens when IndexedDB is unavailable or fails?** The extension should fall back to chrome.storage.local for prompt storage, or display a clear error message if storage is completely unavailable.
- **What happens when Ollama is not running on localhost:3000?** The Ollama tab should display an error message indicating the service is not accessible and provide instructions for setup.
- **What happens when the user tries to import a corrupted settings file?** The import should fail gracefully with an error message, and existing settings should remain unchanged.
- **What happens when an AI provider blocks iframe embedding?** The extension uses declarativeNetRequest to bypass X-Frame-Options headers. If a provider finds another way to block embedding, that provider will fail to load with an appropriate error message.
- **What happens when the sidebar width is too narrow?** The AI provider interface should remain usable at the minimum supported width of 300px, though some content may be condensed.
- **What happens when the user has hundreds or thousands of prompts?** The prompt library should remain performant (per constitution: 1,000+ prompts supported) with search and filtering functionality to manage large collections.

### Key Entities

- **AI Provider**: Represents an AI service (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) with attributes: name, base URL, icon, enabled state, iframe configuration, optional CSS customizations. Providers are configured in a modular way allowing easy addition/removal.

- **Prompt**: A reusable text template saved by the user with attributes: unique ID, title, category (Coding/Writing/Analysis/Custom), tags (array of strings), content (the actual prompt text), creation timestamp, last modified timestamp.

- **User Settings**: Configuration preferences including: enabled providers list, default provider ID, theme preference (light/dark/auto), keyboard shortcut customizations (managed by browser), last selected provider.

- **Provider Session State**: Ephemeral state for each AI provider including: current iframe URL, scroll position, any injected CSS. This state is maintained while the sidebar is open but may not persist across browser restarts.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

## Assumptions

- Users have active accounts with the AI providers they wish to use (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Users are logged into AI providers in regular browser tabs before opening the sidebar (for cookie-based authentication to work)
- AI provider websites remain accessible and don't fundamentally change their authentication or anti-iframe mechanisms
- Users have sufficient browser storage quota for their prompt library (IndexedDB typically allows 50MB+ per origin)
- For Ollama support, users have Ollama and Open WebUI installed and running on localhost:3000
- Users are running modern versions of Edge (114+) or Chrome (114+) that support Manifest V3 and the sidePanel API
- Browser permissions for declarativeNetRequest and host access to AI provider domains are granted during installation
