## Debugging

### Check Console Logs

**Sidebar Console (for postMessage sending):**
- Right-click sidebar â†’ "Inspect"
- Look for messages about sending text to iframe

**Provider iframe Console (for text injection):**
- Right-click inside the provider iframe â†’ "Inspect" (this opens the iframe's console)
- Look for console messages:
  - "Text injection listener registered for {provider}" (initialization)
  - "Text injected into {Provider} editor" (success)
  - "{Provider} editor not found, will retry..." (waiting for page load)
  - "Failed to inject text into {Provider}" (error)
  - "Text injected into {Provider} editor (retry)" (retry success)

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: Text not appearing**
- Check if you're logged into the AI provider
- Check console for errors
- Verify the provider's UI hasn't changed (selector might be outdated)

**Issue 2: Sidebar doesn't open**
- Check if extension is enabled
- Check browser console for errors
- Try reloading the extension

**Issue 3: Text appears but formatting is wrong**
- Expected behavior: contenteditable elements may render differently
- Linebreaks should be preserved
- Special characters should work

**Issue 4: Delay before text appears**
- Expected: Up to 500ms initial delay + 1000ms retry if needed
- This ensures iframe is fully loaded
